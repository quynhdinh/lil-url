Let’s face it — long URLs are annoying. They’re messy, hard to remember, and just don’t look good when you’re trying to share them in a message, on social media, or even on a poster.

That’s where lil-url comes in. It’s a simple tool that takes a long, ugly URL and turns it into a short, clean one that’s easy to share and use. Think of it like your own mini version of TinyURL.

The goal is to make link sharing easier, faster, and more user-friendly. And along the way, we might throw in some cool extras like custom aliases, link tracking, expiration dates, and an API so developers can plug it into their own apps.
